# Node.js_Application_Lab


This lab went off relatively well. I was able to perform each stage with relative ease.
I was able to first display a message on localhost:3001, then on localhost:3002, and then link the sql database to the localhost:3002 and display users and handles.
The final task was also achieved with relative ease. I was able to open the index.html file and add myself to the database, and then go to localhost:3002/handles/Andy%20Molla.

In terms of problems, sometimes the documentation for the lab was a little unclear about where some code snippets go, but some thinking and about 1 or 2 minutes of time allowed me to realize where the code goes. I also had not realized that creating a new directory meant creating a new file in the repo, but again a little bit of thinking and testing allowed me to realize my mistakes.
